Modern control systems often make use of model predictive control. When linear models are used, a set of linear equations must be solved. Algorithms to solve a system of linear equations have been extensively studied and implemented in the past. However when non linear models are used, a set of non linear equations must be solved. These are typically solved with iterative algorithms. The current available algorithms, are costly in memory and CPU usage. This is where the PANOC algorithm comes in, as it uses a very limited amount of memory. And still maintains the super linear convergence.

In this thesis a framework was constructed in Matlab and Python that generates a non linear MPC controller in C code using the PANOC algorithm. The library is specifically aimed at embedded devices as these have a low amounts of memory. 

In the first chapters the PANOC algorithm is discussed. Followed by a high level view of nmpc-codegen, the software package constructed with this thesis. Some simulation results are included to compare the implementation to some of the state of the art solver. The final chapter discuses a recent improvement of the PANOC algorithm with MPC. By defining and solving the MPC problem iteratively, the performance can be significantly improved.
